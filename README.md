## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 AES Encryption from Scratch  
*Spring 2025*
Implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Python without relying on external libraries.  
This project includes all core components of AES: key expansion, SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey operations, as well as encryption/decryption of 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit blocks.

### 🔧 Solving Feedback Control of Dynamical Systems with Reinforcement Learning  
*Spring 2025 – Research Project under Dr. Steffen Werner*

Applied reinforcement learning to compute feedback control for stabilizing unstable linear systems.  
Leveraged eigenspace reduction to isolate unstable modes, dramatically improving training efficiency.  
Successfully trained neural network controllers on reduced models and deployed them on full systems—including a 4,489-state heat flow model.
