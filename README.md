## 📂 Projects

### 🏛️ Similarity Search Tool for U.S. Census Bureau's Working Papers  
*Spring 2025*

In collaboration with two other students, we designed and implemented a custom search tool for the U.S. Census Bureau to efficiently locate relevant working papers using natural language processing.

**Overview**  
- Developed a web scraper with **Selenium** to collect working paper metadata and documents from the Census Bureau website.  
- Used **Sentence-BERT** (via the `sentence-transformers` library) to encode paper texts and user queries into vector embeddings.  
- Built a similarity search using cosine similarity to rank papers by relevance to natural language queries.  
- Created a clean, user-friendly interface.

**Key Technologies**  
- Python  
- Selenium (web scraping)  
- Sentence-BERT (semantic embeddings)  
- scikit-learn (cosine similarity)

### 🔐 AES Encryption from Scratch  
*Spring 2025*

Implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Python without external libraries.  
Includes all core AES components: key expansion, SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey, supporting 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit blocks.

### 🔧 Solving Feedback Control of Dynamical Systems with Reinforcement Learning  
*Spring 2025 – Research Project under Dr. Steffen Werner*

Applied reinforcement learning to compute feedback control for stabilizing unstable linear systems.  
Leveraged eigenspace reduction to isolate unstable modes, improving training efficiency.  
Trained neural network controllers on reduced models and deployed on full systems—including a 4,489-state heat flow model.

### 💊 Medicaid Drug Spending Analysis  
*November 2024*

Analyzed U.S. Medicaid prescription drug data to identify spending trends across therapeutic classes and manufacturers. Built regression models and created an interactive dashboard.

**Tools:** R, ggplot2, flexdashboard, dplyr, tidyr

**Key Features**  
- Cleaned multi-year Medicaid data  
- Modeled spending with Multiple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression  
- Visualized spending patterns by drug type and manufacturer count
