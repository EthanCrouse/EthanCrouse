## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 AES Encryption from Scratch  
*Spring 2025*

Implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Python without relying on external libraries.  
This project includes all core components of AES: key expansion, SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey operations, as well as encryption/decryption of 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit blocks.

### 🔧 Solving Feedback Control of Dynamical Systems with Reinforcement Learning  
*Spring 2025 – Research Project under Dr. Steffen Werner*

Applied reinforcement learning to compute feedback control for stabilizing unstable linear systems.  
Leveraged eigenspace reduction to isolate unstable modes, dramatically improving training efficiency.  
Successfully trained neural network controllers on reduced models and deployed them on full systems—including a 4,489-state heat flow model.

### 🤖 ProseAI 

*January 2025 - Present*

ProseAI is an AI-powered email assistant that automatically drafts replies to unread emails using your writing style.

**Overview**

This project connects to your email inbox (Gmail via IMAP), fetches unread emails, and generates context-aware replies that mimic your tone and writing style. It uses example text you've written to prompt a large language model (LLM) like Meta's Llama 3B for personalized responses.

Ideal for professionals who want to streamline inbox management without losing their voice.

 **Key Features**

- 📥 Securely connects to your Gmail inbox via IMAP
- 📨 Fetches and parses unread messages
- 🧠 Uses a few short examples of your writing to generate replies
- ✍️ Outputs personalized responses for review

###  💊 Medicaid Drug Spending Analysis

*November 2024*

Analyzed U.S. Medicaid prescription drug data to uncover trends in spending across therapeutic classes and manufacturer types. Built regression models (MLR & Ridge) and an interactive `flexdashboard` to visualize models.

**Tools:** R, ggplot2, flexdashboard, dplyr, tidyr

**Key Features**
- Cleaned multi-year Medicaid data
- Modeled spending using MLR and Ridge Regression
- Visualized patterns by drug type and manufacturer count
